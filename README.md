# Isle Of Dogs Translation Project

The aim of this project is to translate the Japanese portions of the Wes Anderson movie Isle of Dogs to English subtitles. Most of the speech has so far been translated, however some speech, in particular those of Major Domo, have yet to been translated. Some of the translations may also not be entirely accurate. 

If you can provide any missing translations, or better translations, please contact the project owner at **boysamurai18@gmail.com**
