1
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,310
This is a crisis!

2
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,150
Accepting dissenting opinions is in accordance with the laws of this country

3
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Show respect

4
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,470
Science public relations Professor Watanabe

5
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,150
This is unfair to the dogs

6
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,450
Isn't the dog a friend of man?

7
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,960
If you're watching, to personally show unity with the people

8
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:07,978
Did you see me lose my wings and crash?

9
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,050
I came to search for my dog

10
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,060
Spots, spots

11
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,430
Spots

12
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,160
This is your bodyguard dog

13
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,290
He is for your safety

14
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,050
He will protect you forever

15
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,520
Hey!

16
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,100
There is no reason for him to lick your hand

17
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,850
This is not a pet

18
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,900
This is a bodyguard dog

19
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,500
Not a pet

20
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,950
You can commuicate using this

21
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,950
You try

22
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,160
Calling...

23
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,760
...Bodyguard dog

24
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,422
Can you hear me?

25
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,160
You will protect me forever

26
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,950
Professor Watanabe, we applied serum injection and mechanical vibration until the blood temperature of the experimental animal decreased

27
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,760
I got the best results

28
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,780
Minister of Science Watanabe, no arrhythmia forming or dripping

29
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,790
High voltage

30
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,660
I have guaranteed safety and proven to be very beneficial

31
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,640
Watanabe, power image technology can be observed to condense in a lower-level test centrifuge

32
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,550
The strong tendency to reproduce has been dramatically reduced

33
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,510
As a reward for all successful attempts by all the gatherings

34
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,660
Please drink

35
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Toast!

36
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,020
Hooray!

37
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,340
Thank you all very much

38
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,850
I refuse

39
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,470
Enough, I'll cutting the call

40
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Please go on

41
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,950
Cured

42
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,050
Treatable

43
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,160
Sustainable

44
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,730
Hello

45
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,050
Please do it later

46
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:15,750
Yes

47
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,820
Blood tests, timings, heartbeats

48
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,440
I do not like this

49
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,260
I think this has solved the problem or I don't understand what the real problem is?

50
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,660
All dogs stay on Trash Island

51
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:31,146
Atari-sama

52
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:36,519
Let us rescue you

53
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,140
Why did you follow me?

54
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,457
Get out from here!

55
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,099
He hit the remote monitor

56
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,460
That little boy ruined the guidance device

57
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,696
My ward Atari

58
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,050
We will take a commercial break

59
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,050
Let me tell you a little something

60
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,660
Horrible things will happen soon

61
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,550
There is going to be a war between humans and dogs

62
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,630
Look at what some of them did to us!

63
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,450
All right

64
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,950
From now on

65
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,700
You guys

66
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,540
Are my dogs

67
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,270
Sit!

68
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,540
Sit

69
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,320
Professor Watanabe, a candidate for the Science Party, has been arrested today

70
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,760
This is a very difficult situation

71
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,740
Let's think of an idea

72
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,960
Stop for a minute

73
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute

74
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,160
As you know, we all hate dogs

75
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,480
People have been brainwashed

76
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,910
Coming up next we discuss the re-election campaign

77
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,250
Fetch

78
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,600
Fetch!

79
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,160
Fetch?

80
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,240
Good boy

81
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,650
It is a biscuit

82
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,980
I wish I had two

83
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,190
I should have brought more

84
00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:05,910
It is late. Time to sleep. I am working. I'm understand. Good night.

85
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,160
Spots?

86
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,530
Spots

87
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,860
I shouldn't have given you up to them. I'm really sorry for making you feel lonely and painful. I came to rescue you.

88
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:08,480
The personal life of a young boy...

89
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:07,410
Biscuit

90
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,260
Biscuit, biscuit, biscuit

91
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,360
I have to go back to the city

92
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,660
They're not sane anymore

93
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,130
Sadly but

94
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,840
New bodyguard dog

95
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,140
I will accept

96
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,330
Of course, I have respect and affection

97
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:22,740
I will protect you more than when I was with your older brother

98
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,420
It's too late

99
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:25,840
Too late

100
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,270
Too late

101
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,180
No one cares

102
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:37,430
Nobody cares

103
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,540
Ben is dead

104
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,340
No future on Trash Island

105
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,838
I am failure

106
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:33,390
Last dose

107
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:38,580
Tracy

108
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:40,770
Be careful

109
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:59,220
Megasaki

110
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:03,910
Even if you have the flu...

111
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,600
Sit

112
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,930
I have the results of ballot counting

113
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:53,750
Who is it?

114
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,010
Who are these people?

115
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:10,610
Show respect

116
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,480
This small number of opponents

117
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:02,550
Major Domo, bring the button

118
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,640
Megasaki high school

119
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,700
Who are we?

120
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:36,490
I wrote a haiku to express my feelings for the dogs suffering on Trash Island

121
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,530
Why why

122
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,190
Friend of man

123
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,890
Flowers scattered in spring

124
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,300
Unfair to the boy

125
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:14,990
Unfair to the dogs

126
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,390
I did no honor

127
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:30,800
Bring the Trash Island decree

128
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:54,215
I can't do it

129
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:09.648
Press that button now if you don't want to face a coup

130
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:06,420
The correction to the brain was a great success, but the kidney on the left side was damaged due to the burden of extraction

131
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,470
Use my left kidney

132
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,670
Give it to Atari

133
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:06,830
By the law

134
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:46,450
That's right

135
01:32:48,782 --> 01:32:49,378
Death

136
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:54,000
I think that is overkill

137
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:14,240
I'm heading over there now
